Hi all,

Quick question: what do propertystore.db and propertystore.db.strings store, respectively?

My CSV headers look like these:

edges -- :START_ID, :END_ID, :TYPE, timestamp:LONG, attr
nodes -- :ID, name0, ..., name39

And propertystore.db totals 10GB, propertystore.db.strings totals 17GB.  I did a quick calculation, assuming those two files store serialized JVM Strings, all the node properties should total 6GB in memory, and all the edge properties should total 17GB in memory -- the first number doesn't match the size of propertystore.db, so I am a bit confused.

Thanks in advance,
Zongheng
