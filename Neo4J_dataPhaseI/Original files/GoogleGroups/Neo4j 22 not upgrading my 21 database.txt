Has anyone had trouble upgrading a 2.1.x database to 2.2.3?

The database immediately shuts down, with no log noise to speak of:

unnamed-80:neo4j-community-2.2.3 joe$ bin/neo4j console

Starting Neo4j Server console-mode...

Using additional JVM arguments:  -server -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Dorg.neo4j.server.properties=conf/neo4j-server.properties -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow -XX:hashCode=5 -Dneo4j.ext.udc.source=tarball

2015-07-16 07:20:35.642+0000 INFO  [API] Setting startup timeout to: 120000ms based on 120000

2015-07-16 07:20:36.521+0000 INFO  [API] Successfully shutdown Neo4j Server.


I'm using the stock configuration files with:

allow_store_upgrade=true


in neo4j.properties.

Should I be doing anything else?

Thanks,
Joe

can you check graph.db/messages.log for any errors?

but there are no permission issues?
