Hi,

I am new to Neo4j and cypher quries.

can you help me in the following query:

MATCH (c:Customer)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[r:CUST_RESERVED]-(res:Reservation)
with c,r,res
where r IS NULL OR (res.end_date < "20150715" OR res.start_date >= "20150815")
return count(c)


I want to count the customers that are : reserved less than 2 times between 15/07 and 15/08


so I thought to get:
- not reserved in the period between 07/15 and 08/15 (Already achieved)
- OR reserved less than 2 times between 15/07 and 15/08 (how ?)


how can I define the second part ?
