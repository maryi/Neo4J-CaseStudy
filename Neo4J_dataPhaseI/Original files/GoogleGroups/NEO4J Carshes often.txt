Hello All,
        We have a NEO4J instance running on a Amazon Ubuntu Server (8GB ram). We have allocated below 4GB - 6GB memory for Neo4J (which is the only software on the server). The server constantly seems to crash due to memory issues. I am attaching the error log. Can you please suggest how we could fix this?

Thanks in advance!

Regards,
Harshal

this sounds like access to off-heap memory for mmio

can you share your graph.db/messages.log ?

can you share your config?

there is mmio-memory config in neo4j.properties 
and heap config in neo4j-wrapper.conf

which should in total not exceed your 6G 

what are you running there? perhaps share the type of workload / queries

Hello Michael,
         Please find the config and log files attached. Please take a look and suggest what changes are required.

We currently have 400K nodes in the graph. We have about 6 - 7 properties per node.
We only have 2 relationships (hasChild and hasParent).
The graph looks like a taxonomy of nodes.

Please suggest how we could fix this issue.

Thanks,
Harshal
