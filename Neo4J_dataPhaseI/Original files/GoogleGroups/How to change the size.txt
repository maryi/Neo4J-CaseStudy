Does anyone know which parameters can affect the size of the off-heap memory?
In neo4j documentation, they said that the size of the off-heap memory can be modified with the dbms.pagecache.memory parameter.
I tried changing the size of this parameter, but when I check the off-heap memory with jconsole, the size is always the same.
PS: I'm working with the free version of neo4j.

dbms.pagecache.memory is for Neo4j 2.2.+
for 2.1.x see this http://neo4j.com/docs/2.1.8/configuration-io-examples.html
