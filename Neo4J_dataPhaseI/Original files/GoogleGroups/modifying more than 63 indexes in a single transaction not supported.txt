Running 2.2.3 I뭢 getting this error:

IllegalStateException: modifying more than 63 indexes in a single transaction not supported. This is being thrown rom IndexDefineCommand.getOrAssignId

Can someone explain this? It seems to be new in 2.2.3

It is a safeguard that was not in there before, due to the size of a tx-command we limited the concurrent index # that are updated in one tx.

What is your use-case that you update more than 63 indexes in a single tx?
Or is the error thrown incorrectly?

Cheers, Michael

Unsure. I need to track down specifically why this is happening.

This be clear, given the following example with 2 created nodes:
Node a - prop1 : v1, prop2 : v2
Node b - prop1: v3, prop2: v4

Does this count as 2 index updates (because only two different property keys were updated) or 4 because each value was unique?

Afaik the message only is related to manual indexes and only counts per index (file)

We see the same exception when bulk-updating nodes with more than 63 properties (which is a common use-case) in one transaction with Structr.

There are only three manual indexes, so there's something wrong in 2.2.3.

It seems to effectively block any manual index update with more than 63 properties involved, is that intended?

I have talked with support and can confirm that you can뭪 update more than 63 indexes in a single transaction. This is intentional and is in place to deal with a problem that can occur when updating more than 63 indexes in a single transaction. It is also only an issue when using legacy (manual) indexes. Schema indexes are automatically updated and don뭪 suffer from this issue.

I'm ok with not being able to update no more than 63 indexes, but we can't update more than 63 properties in a tx. That's a real blocker IMHO.
